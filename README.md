This is gonna be DSL based REST service for your DB. Something like PostgRest but not for PostgreSQL and written in Rust instead Haskell.

Right now I'm focusing on Sqlite as a main DB backend, because why not. Later will add all DB that are supported by sqlx library.


I hope it will be an interesting project for you. But there is a lot work needed to be done here. Please visit this project later in one or two months.
